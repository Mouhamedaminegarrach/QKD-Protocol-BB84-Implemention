# QKD-Protocol-BB84-Implemention
Implementation of BB84 protocols on IBM QX demon- strate the implementation of the BB84 protocol utilizing Qiskit Circuit locally and on IBM QX devices , and display the final produced key with a graphic user interface.

# context
Rather of utilizing traditional encryption, quantum cryptography (QC) allows for the safe exchange of an enciphering key across a private channel. Quantum computing is used in the wireless body sensor network to assure the security of information flow. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a quantum-based secure communication technology. It will produce a shared random secret key that only the persons involved in the communication will be aware of. Using the known private key, messages are encrypted and decoded.

# Problem
The distribution of keys is an important issue in cryptography. The issue is about the following: actions: During key generation, another unauthorized entity may copy or sniff the key.

# Goals
Alice and Bob want to establish a secret key for subsequent communication via Classical Channel

# Settings
Alice and Bob:
1. a secure Lab
2. access to a Quantum Channel (conserves Qubit states)
3. a classical communication channel (public channel, e.g. internet)
